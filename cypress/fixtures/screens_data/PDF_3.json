The $1.50 monthly service charge will be waived if a customer opts to only receive electronic statements.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Minimum Daily Balance Credit: <\/strong>There is a $0.20 credit back for each $100.00 of minimum daily balance for the statement cycle. If the earning credit exceeds the fees for any period, you will be assessed no fees but you will not be paid, carry forward or otherwise receive credit for any excess earning credit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>YOUR ABILITY TO WITHDRAW FUNDS<\/h4>\n<p>This policy statement applies to checking and savings deposit accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Our policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits available to you on the first business day after the day we receive your deposit. Electronic direct deposits will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Once the funds are available, you can withdraw them in cash and we will use the funds to pay checks that you have written.<\/p>\n<p>Please remember that even after we have made funds available to you and you have withdrawn the funds, you are still responsible for checks you deposit that are returned to us unpaid and for any other problems involving your deposit.<\/p>\n<p>For determining the availability of your deposits, every day is a business day, except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays. If you make a deposit before 1:00 p.m. on a business day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit after 1:00 p.m. or on a day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit was made on the next<\/p>\n<p>business day we are open. If we cash a check for you that is drawn on another bank, we may withhold the availability of a corresponding amount of funds that are already in your accounts. Those funds will be available at the time funds from the check we cashed would have been available if you had deposited it.<\/p>\n<p>If we accept for deposit a check that is drawn on another bank, we may make funds from the deposit available for withdrawal immediately but delay your availability to withdraw a corresponding amount of funds that you have on deposit in another account with us. The funds in the other account would then not be available for withdrawal until the time periods that are described elsewhere in this disclosure for the type of check that you deposited.<\/p>\n<h4>Longer Delays May Apply<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Case-By-Case Delays - <\/strong>In some cases, we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by check available to you on the first business day after the day of your deposit. Depending on the type of check that you deposit, funds may not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit. The first $225 of your deposits, however, will be available on the first business day.<\/p>\n<p>If we are not going to make all of the funds from your deposit available on the first business day after we receive your deposit, we will notify you at the time you make your deposit. We will also tell you when the funds will be available. If your deposit is not made directly to one of our employees, or if we decide to take this action after you have left the premises, we will mail you the notice by the day after we receive your deposit.<\/p>\n<p>If you will need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Safeguard Exceptions - <\/strong>In addition, funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We believe a check you deposit will not be paid.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>You deposit checks totalling more than $5,525 on any one day.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>You redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>You have overdrawn your account repeatedly in the last six months.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>There is an emergency, such as failure of computer or communications equipment.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be available. They will generally be available no later than the seventh business day after the day of your deposit.<\/p>\n<h4>Special Rules for New Accounts<\/h4>\n<p>If you are a new customer, the following special rules will apply during the first 30 days your account is open.<\/p>\n<p>Funds from electronic direct deposits to your account will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Funds from deposits of cash, wire transfers, and the first $5,525 of a day's total deposits of cashier's, certified, teller's, traveller's, and federal, state and local government checks will be available on the first business day after the day of your deposit if the deposit meets certain conditions. For example, the checks must be payable to you (and you may have to use a special deposit slip). The excess over $5,525 will be available on the ninth business day after the day of your deposit. If your deposit of these checks (other than a U.S. Treasury check) is not made in person to one of our employees, the first $5,525 will not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit.<\/p>\n<p>Funds from all other check deposits will be available on the tenth business day after the day of your deposit.<\/p>\n<h4>SUBSTITUTE CHECKS AND YOUR RIGHTS<\/h4>\n<p><strong>What is a substitute check?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To make check processing faster, federal law permits banks to replace original checks with \"substitute checks.\" These checks are similar in size to original checks with a slightly reduced image of the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states: \"This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check.\" You may use a substitute check as proof of payment just like the original check.<\/p>\n<p>Some or all of the checks that you receive back from us may be substitute checks. This notice describes the rights you have when you receive substitute checks from us. The rights in this notice do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits to your account. However, you have rights under other law with respect to those transactions.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are my rights regarding substitute checks?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that allows you to request a refund for losses you suffer if a substitute check is posted to your account (for example, if you think that we withdrew the wrong amount from your account or that we withdrew money from your account more than once for the same check). The losses you may attempt to recover under this procedure may include the amount that was withdrawn from your account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal (for example, bounced check fees).<\/p>\n<p>The amount of your refund under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the amount of the substitute check, whichever is less. You also are entitled to interest on the amount of your refund if your account is an interest-bearing account. If your loss exceeds the amount of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional amounts under other law.<\/p>\n<p>If you use this procedure, you may receive up to $2,500.00 of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) within 10 business day(s) after we received your claim and the remainder of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) not later than 45 calendar day(s) after we received your claim.<\/p>\n<p>We may reverse the refund (including any interest on the refund) if we later are able to demonstrate that the substitute check was correctly posted to your account.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How do I make a claim for a refund?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you believe that you have suffered a loss relating to a substitute check that you received and that was posted to your account, please contact us at:<\/p>\n<p>Swedish-American State Bank<br \/>324 Liberty St<br \/>PO Box 350<br \/>Courtland KS 66939<br \/>Phone: (785)374-4231<\/p>\n<p>You must contact us within 40 calendar days of the date that we mailed (or otherwise delivered by a means to which you agreed) the substitute check in question or the account statement showing that the substitute check was posted to your account, whichever is later. We will extend this time period if you were not able to make a timely claim because of extraordinary circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Your claim must include--<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A description of why you have suffered a loss (for example, you think the amount withdrawn was incorrect);<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>An estimate of the amount of your loss;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>An explanation of why the substitute check you received is insufficient to confirm that you suffered a loss; and<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>A copy of the substitute check and\/or the following information to help us identify the substitute check: the check number, the amount of the check and the name of the person to whom you wrote the check.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS<\/h4>\n<h4>YOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES<\/h4>\n<p>Indicated below are types of Electronic Fund Transfers we are capable of handling, some of which may not apply to your account. Please read this disclosure carefully because it tells you your rights and obligations for the transactions listed. You should keep this notice for future reference.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Electronic Fund Transfers Initiated By Third Parties - <\/strong>You may authorize a third party to initiate electronic fund transfers between your account and the third party's account. These transfers to make or receive payment may be one-time occurrences or may recur as directed by you. These transfers may use the Automated Clearing House (ACH) or other payments network. Your authorization to the third party to make these transfers can occur in a number of ways. For example, your authorization to convert a check to an electronic fund transfer or to electronically pay a returned check charge can occur when a merchant provides you with notice and you go forward with the transaction (typically, at the point of purchase, a merchant will post a sign and print the notice on a receipt). In all cases, these third party transfers will require you to provide the third party with your account number and financial institution information. This information can be found on your check as well as on a deposit or withdrawal slip. Thus, you should only provide your financial institution and account information (whether over the phone, the Internet, or via some other method) to trusted third parties whom you have authorized to initiate these electronic fund transfers. Examples of these transfers include, but are not limited to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preauthorized credits -<\/strong> You may make arrangements for certain direct deposits to be accepted into your checking or savings.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preauthorized payments -<\/strong> You may make arrangements to pay certain recurring bills from your checking or savings.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Electronic check conversion -<\/strong> You may authorize a merchant or other payee to make a one-time electronic payment from your checking account using information from your check to pay for purchases or pay bills.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Electronic returned check charge -<\/strong> You may authorize a merchant or other payee to initiate an electronic funds transfer to collect a charge in the event a check is returned for insufficient funds.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>SHAZAM ATM transactions - <\/strong>types of transactions - You may access your account(s) by ATM using your SHAZAM and your personal identification number (PIN) (as applicable) to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>withdraw cash from checking or savings<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>get balance information about checking or savings<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some of these services may not be available at all terminals.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SHAZAM point-of-sale transactions -<\/strong> types of transactions<\/p>\n<p>You may access your checking account(s) using your SHAZAM to do transactions that participating merchants will accept, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>purchase goods in person, by phone, or online<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>pay for services in person, by phone, or online<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>get cash from a participating merchant or financial institution<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Currency Conversion and International Transactions -<\/strong>&nbsp;When you use your VISA(R) debit card at a merchant that settles in currency other than US dollars, the charge will be converted into the US dollar amount. The currency conversion rate used to determine the transaction amount in US dollars is either a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The conversion rate in effect on the processing date may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date or posting date.<\/p>\n<p>Visa USA charges us a .8% International Service Assessment on all international transactions, regardless of whether there is a currency conversion. If there is a currency conversion, the International Service Assessment is 1% of the transaction. The fee we charge you for international transactions\/currency conversions is disclosed separately. An international transaction is a transaction where the country of the merchant is outside the USA.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Advisory Against Illegal Use - <\/strong>You agree not to use your SHAZAM for illegal gambling or other illegal purposes. Display of a payment card logo by, for example, an online merchant does not necessarily mean that transactions are lawful in the jurisdiction in which you may be located.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Online Banking -<\/strong> types of transfers - You may access your accounts at www.mysasb.com and using your user name and password to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>transfer funds from checking, savings to savings, checking<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>make payments from checking, savings to loans<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>get balance information about checking, savings, certificate of deposit or Loans<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>get withdrawal history about checking, savings, certificate of deposit or Loans<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>get deposit history about checking, savings, certificate of deposit or Loans<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>get transaction history about checking, savings, certificate of deposit or Loans<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Bill Pay -<\/strong> types of transfers -&nbsp;You may access this service by computer at www.mysasb.com and using your user name and password.<\/p>\n<p>You may access this service to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>make payments from your checking account(s) to third parties<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>(Some payments made by paper check will not be subject to this Electronic Fund Transfers disclosure, as disclosed separately. Prohibited payment types are defined in the Bill Pay terms and conditions.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Limits and fees -<\/strong> Please refer to our fee disclosure for information about fees and limitations that may apply to these electronic fund transfers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ATM Operator\/Network Fees -<\/strong> When you use an ATM not owned by us, you may be charged a fee by the ATM operator or any network used (and you may be charged a fee for a balance inquiry even if you do not complete a fund transfer).<\/p>\n<p>Security limitations - For security reasons, there are other limits on the number of transfers you can make using our computer transaction service.<\/p>\n<h4>Documentation<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Terminal transfers -<\/strong> You can get a receipt at the time you make a transfer to or from your account using an automated teller machine or point-of-sale terminal. However, you may not get a receipt if the amount of the transfer is $15 or less.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Periodic statements - <\/strong>You will get a monthly account statement from us for your checking, money market account(s).<\/p>\n<p>You will get a monthly account statement from us for your savings account(s), unless there are no transfers in a particular month. In any case, you will get a statement at least quarterly.<\/p>\n<h4>Preauthorized Payments<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Right to stop payment and procedure for doing so -<\/strong> If you have told us in advance to make regular payments out of your account, you can stop any of these payments. Here is how:<\/p>\n<p>Call or write us at the telephone number or address listed in this disclosure in time for us to receive your request three business days or more before the payment is scheduled to be made. If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us within 14 days after you call.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Notice of varying amounts -<\/strong> If these regular payments may vary in amount, the person you are going to pay will tell you, 10 days before each payment, when it will be made and how much it will be. (You may choose instead to get this notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount would fall outside certain limits that you set.)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Liability for failure to stop payment of preauthorized transfer -<\/strong> If you order us to stop one of these payments three business days or more before the transfer is scheduled, and we do not do so, we will be liable for your losses or damages.<\/p>\n<h4>Financial Institution's Liability<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Liability for failure to make transfers -<\/strong> If we do not complete a transfer to or from your account on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account to make the transfer.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have an overdraft line and the transfer would go over the credit limit.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the automated teller machine where you are making the transfer does not have enough cash.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If the terminal or system was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transfer.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transfer, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>There may be other exceptions stated in our agreement with you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Confidentiality<\/h4>\n<p>We will disclose information to third parties about your account or the transfers you make:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>where it is necessary for completing transfers; or<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>in order to verify the existence and condition of your account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant; or<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>in order to comply with government agency or court orders; or<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>as described in our privacy policy disclosure, provided separately.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Unauthorized Transfers<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consumer liability.<\/strong> (1) Generally. Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your card and\/or code has been lost or stolen or if you believe that an electronic fund transfer has been made without your permission using information from your check. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum overdraft line of credit). If you tell us within two business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your card and\/or code, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your card and\/or code without your permission.<\/p>\n<p>If you do NOT tell us within two business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your card and\/or code, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your card and\/or code without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made by card, code or other means, tell us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the statement was mailed to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.<\/p>\n<p>If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time period.<\/p>\n<p>(2) Additional Limit on Liability for VISA(R) card. Unless you have been grossly negligent or have engaged in fraud, you will not be liable for any unauthorized transactions using your lost or stolen VISA card. This additional limit on liability does not apply to ATM transactions, or to transactions using your Personal Identification Number which are not processed by VISA.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Contact in event of unauthorized transfer.<\/strong> If you believe your card and\/or code has been lost or stolen, call or write us at the telephone number or address listed in this disclosure. You should also call the number or write to the address listed in this disclosure if you believe a transfer has been made using the information from your check without your permission.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Error Resolution Notice<\/h4>\n<p>In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Electronic Transfers, Call or Write us at the telephone number or address listed in this disclosure, as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Tell us your name and account number (if any).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.<\/p>\n<p>We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days (5 business days for point-of-sale transactions processed by Visa and 20 business days if the transfer involved a new account) after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days (90 days if the transfer involved a new account, a point-of-sale transaction, or a foreign-initiated transfer) to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your account within 10 business days (5 business days if the transfer involved a point-of-sale transaction and 20 business days if the transfer involved a new account) for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account. Your account is considered a new account for the first 30 days after the first deposit is made unless each of you already has an established account with us before the account is opened.<\/p>\n<p>We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.<\/p>\n<p>You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.<\/p>\n<p>If you have inquiries regarding your account, please contact us at:<\/p>\n<p>Swedish-American State Bank<br \/>Kathy Johnson<br \/>324 Liberty St<br \/>PO Box 350<br \/>Courtland, KS 66939<\/p>\n<p>BUSINESS DAYS: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

For your own safety, be careful. The following suggestions may be helpful.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Prepare for your transactions at home (for instance, by filling out a deposit slip) to minimize your time at the ATM or night deposit facility.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Mark each transaction in your account record, but not while at the ATM or night deposit facility. Always save your ATM receipts. Don't leave them at the ATM or night deposit facility because they may contain important account information.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Compare your records with the account statements you receive.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't lend your ATM card to anyone.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Remember, do not leave your card at the ATM. Do not leave any documents at a night deposit facility.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Protect the secrecy of your Personal Identification Number (PIN). Protect your ATM card as though it were cash. Don't tell anyone your PIN. Don't give anyone information regarding your ATM card or PIN over the telephone. Never enter your PIN in any ATM that does not look genuine, has been modified, has a suspicious device attached, or is operating in a suspicious manner. Don't write your PIN where it can be discovered. For example, don't keep a note of your PIN in your wallet or purse.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Prevent others from seeing you enter your PIN by using your body to shield their view.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If you lose your ATM card or if it is stolen, promptly notify us. You should consult the other disclosures you have received about electronic fund transfers for additional information about what to do if your card is lost or stolen.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>When you make a transaction, be aware of your surroundings. Look out for suspicious activity near the ATM or night deposit facility, particularly if it is after sunset. At night, be sure that the facility (including the parking area and walkways) is well lighted. Consider having someone accompany you when you use the facility, especially after sunset.&nbsp;If you observe any problem, go to another ATM or&nbsp;night deposit facility.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't accept assistance from anyone you don't&nbsp;know when using an ATM or night deposit facility.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If you notice anything suspicious or if any other problem arises after you have begun an ATM transaction, you may want to cancel the transaction, pocket your card and leave. You might consider using another ATM or coming back later.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don't display your cash; pocket it as soon as the ATM transaction is completed and count the cash later when you are in the safety of your own car, home, or other secure surrounding.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>At a drive-up facility, make sure all the car doors are locked and all of the windows are rolled up, except the driver's window. Keep the engine running and remain alert to your surroundings.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you. Therefore, please tell us if you know of any problem with a facility. For instance, let us know if a light is not working or there is any damage to a facility. Please report any suspicious activity or crimes to both the operator of the facility and the local law enforcement officials immediately.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>MORE DETAILED INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON REQUEST<\/p>\n<h4>COMMON FEATURES<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Limits and fees -<\/strong> The following fees may be assessed against your account and the following transaction limitations, if any, apply to your account:<\/p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Check Printing<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">depends on the style of check ordered<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Money Orders<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$1.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Paid NSF Debit Fees (each debit or check paid)<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$25.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Return NSF Debit Fee (each debit or check paid)<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$30.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stop Payment charge<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$7.50<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Outgoing Wire Transfer Fee<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$15.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Consecutive 7 Day Overdraft Fee<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$14.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Garnishment<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$10.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5x5&nbsp;Safe Deposit Box<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$5.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5x10&nbsp;Safe Deposit Box<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$10.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Debit Card Replacement<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$5.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Account Research (per item)<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$5.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reprint Imaged Statement<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$5.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>POS daily limit<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">$500.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Safe Deposit Box Drilling<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">&nbsp;<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dormant Account<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">&nbsp;<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h4>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF YOUR ACCOUNT<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Contents:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT -<\/strong> To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.

You will receive a separate schedule of rates, qualifying balances, and fees if they are not included in this document. If you have any questions, please call us.<\/p>\n<p>This agreement is subject to applicable federal laws, the laws of the state in which our office is located and other<\/p>\n<p>applicable rules such as the operating letters of the Federal Reserve Banks and payment processing system rules (except to the extent that this agreement can and does vary such rules or laws). The body of state and federal law that governs our relationship with you, however, is too large and complex to be reproduced here. The purpose of this document is to:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>summarize some laws that apply to common transactions;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>establish rules to cover transactions or events which the law does not regulate;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>establish rules for certain transactions or events which the law regulates but permits variation by agreement; and<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>give you disclosures of some of our policies to which you may be entitled or in which you may be interested.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If any provision of this document is found to be unenforceable according to its terms, all remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. We may permit some variations from our standard agreement, but we must agree to any variation in writing either on the signature card for your account or in some other document. Nothing in this document is intended to vary our duty to act in good faith and with ordinary care when required by law.<\/p>\n<p>As used in this document the words \"we,\" \"our,\" and \"us\" mean the financial institution and the words \"you\" and \"your\" mean the account holder(s) and anyone else with the authority to deposit, withdraw, or exercise control over the funds in the account. However, this agreement does not intend, and the terms \"you\" and \"your\" should not be interpreted, to expand an individual's responsibility for an organization's liability. If this account is owned by a corporation, partnership or other organization, individual liability is determined by the laws generally applicable to that type of organization. The headings in this document are for convenience or reference only and will not govern the interpretation of the provisions. Unless it would be inconsistent to do so, words and phrases used in this document should be construed so the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>LIABILITY - <\/strong>You agree, for yourself (and the person or entity you represent if you sign as a representative of another) to the terms of this account and the schedule of charges. You authorize us to deduct these charges, without notice to you, directly from the account balance as accrued. You will pay any additional reasonable charges for services you request which are not covered by this agreement.<\/p>\n<p>Each of you also agrees to be jointly and severally (individually) liable for any account shortage resulting from charges or overdrafts, whether caused by you or another with access to this account. This liability is due immediately, and we can deduct any amounts deposited into the account and apply those amounts to the shortage. You have no right to defer payment of this liability, and you are liable regardless of whether you signed the item or benefited from the charge or overdraft. You will be liable for our costs as well as for our reasonable attorneys' fees, to the extent permitted by law, whether incurred as a result of collection or in any other dispute involving your account. This includes, but not limited to, disputes between you and another joint owner; you and an authorized signer or similar party; or a third party claiming an interest in your account. This also includes any action that you or a third party takes regarding the account that causes us, in good faith, to seek the advice of an attorney, whether or not we become involved in the dispute. All costs and attorneys' fees can be deducted from your account when they are incurred, without notice to you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DEPOSITS -<\/strong> We will give only provisional credit until collection is final for any items, other than cash, we accept for deposit (including items drawn \"on us\"). Before settlement of any item becomes final, we act only as your agent, regardless of the form of endorsement or lack of endorsement on the item and even though we provide you provisional credit for the item. We may reverse any provisional credit for items that are lost, stolen, or returned. Unless prohibited by law, we also reserve the right to charge back to your account the amount of any item deposited to your account or cashed for you which was initially paid by the payor bank and which is later returned to us due to an allegedly forged, unauthorized or missing endorsement, claim of alteration, encoding error, counterfeit cashier's check or other problem which in our judgment justifies reversal of credit. You authorize us to attempt to collect previously returned items without giving you notice, and in attempting to collect we may permit the payor bank to hold an item beyond the midnight deadline. Actual credit for deposits of, or payable in, foreign currency will be at the exchange rate in effect on final collection in U.S. dollars. We are not responsible for transactions by mail or outside depository until we actually record them.<\/p>\n<p>If you deliver a deposit to us and you will not be present when the deposit is counted, you must provide us an itemized list of the deposit (deposit slip). To process the deposit, we will verify and record the deposit, and credit the deposit to the Account. If there are any discrepancies between the amounts shown on the itemized list of the deposit and the amount we determine to be the actual deposit, we will notify you of the discrepancy. You will be entitled to credit only for the actual deposit as determined by us, regardless of what is stated on the itemized deposit slip.<\/p>\n<p>We will treat and record all transactions received after our \"daily cutoff time\" on a business day we are open, or received on a day we are not open for business, as if initiated on the next business day that we are open. At our option, we may take an item for collection rather than for deposit. If we accept a third-party check or draft for deposit, we may require any third-party endorsers to verify or guarantee their endorsements, or endorse to verify or guarantee their endorsements, or endorse in our presence.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>WITHDRAWALS -<br \/>Generally -<\/strong> Unless clearly indicated otherwise on the account records, any of you, acting alone, who signs to open the account or has authority to make withdrawals may withdraw or transfer all or any part of the account balance at any time. Each of you (until we receive written notice to the contrary) authorizes each other person who signs or has authority to make withdrawals to endorse any item payable to you or your order for deposit to this account or any other transaction with us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Postdated checks -<\/strong> A postdated check is one which bears a date later than the date on which the check is written. We may properly pay and charge your account for a postdated check even though payment was made before the date of the check, unless we have received written notice of the postdating in time to have a reasonable opportunity to act. Because we process checks mechanically, your notice will not be effective and we will not be liable for failing to honor your notice unless it precisely identifies the number, date, amount and payee of the item.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Checks and withdrawal rules -<\/strong> If you do not purchase your check blanks from us, you must be certain that we approve the check blanks you purchase. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request which you attempt on forms not approved by us or by any method we do not specifically permit. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request which is greater in number than the frequency permitted, or which is for an amount greater or less than any withdrawal limitations. We will use the date the transaction is completed by us (as opposed to the date you initiate it) to apply the frequency limitations. In addition, we may place limitations on the account until your identity is verified.<\/p>\n<p>Even if we honor a nonconforming request, we are not required to do so later. If you violate the stated transaction limitations (if any), in our discretion we may close your account or reclassify it as a transaction account. If we reclassify your account, your account will be subject to the fees and earnings rules of the new account classification.<\/p>\n<p>If we are presented with an item drawn against your account that would be a \"substitute check,\" as defined by law, but for an error or defect in the item introduced in the substitute check creation process, you agree that we may pay such item.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cash Withdrawals -<\/strong> We recommend you take care when making large cash withdrawals because carrying large amounts of cash may pose a danger to your personal safety. As an alternative to making a large cash withdrawal, you may want to consider a cashier's check or similar instrument. You assume full responsibility of any loss in the event the cash you withdraw is lost, stolen, or destroyed. You agree to hold us harmless from any loss you incur as a result of your decision to withdraw funds in the form of cash.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Multiple signatures, electronic check conversion, and similar transactions - <\/strong>An electronic check conversion transaction is a transaction where a check or similar item is converted into an electronic fund transfer as defined in the Electronic Fund Transfers regulation. In these types of transactions the check or similar item is either removed from circulation (truncated) or given back to you. As a result, we have no opportunity to review the signatures or otherwise examine the original check or item. You agree that, as to these or any items as to which we have no opportunity to examine the signatures, you waive any requirement of multiple signatures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Notice of withdrawal -<\/strong> We reserve the right to require not less than 7 days' notice in writing before each withdrawal from an interest-bearing account other than a time deposit or demand deposit, or from any other savings account as defined by Regulation D. (The law requires us to reserve this right, but it is not our general policy to use it.) Withdrawals from a time account prior to maturity or prior to any notice period may be restricted and may be subject to penalty. See your notice of penalty for early withdrawal.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>OWNERSHIP OF ACCOUNT AND BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION - <\/strong>These rules apply to this account depending on the form of ownership and beneficiary designation, if any, specified on the account records. We make no representations as to the appropriateness or effect of the ownership and beneficiary designations, except as they determine to whom we pay the account funds. INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT - is an account in the name of one person. JOINT ACCOUNT - WITH SURVIVORSHIP (AND NOT AS TENANTS IN COMMON) - is an account in the name of two or more persons. Each of you intend that when you die the balance in the account (subject to any previous pledge to which we have agreed) will belong to the survivor(s). If two or more of you survive, you will own the balance in the account as joint tenants with survivorship and not as tenants in common. JOINT ACCOUNT - NO SURVIVORSHIP (AS TENANTS IN COMMON) - is owned by two or more persons, but none of you intend (merely by opening this account) to create any right of survivorship in any other person. We encourage you to agree and tell us in writing of the percentage of the deposit contributed by each of you. This information will not, however, affect the number of signatures necessary for withdrawal. REVOCABLE TRUST OR PAY-ON-DEATH ACCOUNT - If two or more of you create this type of account, you own the account jointly with survivorship. Beneficiaries cannot withdraw unless:<\/p>\n<p>(1) all persons creating the account die, and (2) the beneficiary is then living. If two or more beneficiaries are named and survive the death of all persons creating the account, beneficiaries will own this account in equal shares, without right of survivorship. The person(s) creating either of these account types may: (1) change beneficiaries, (2) change account types, and (3) withdraw all or part of the account funds at any time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>BUSINESS, ORGANIZATION AND ASSOCIATION ACCOUNTS -<\/strong> Earnings in the form of interest, dividends, or credits will be paid only on collected funds, unless otherwise provided by law or our policy. You represent that you have the authority to open and conduct business on this account on behalf of the entity. We may require the governing body of the entity opening the account to give us a separate authorization telling us who is authorized to act on its behalf. We will honor the authorization until we actually receive written notice of a change from the governing body of the entity.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>STOP PAYMENTS -<\/strong> Unless otherwise provided, the rules in this section cover stopping payment of items such as checks and drafts. Rules for stopping payment of other types of transfers of funds, such as consumer electronic fund transfers, may be established by law or our policy. If we have not disclosed these rules to you elsewhere, you may ask us about those rules.<\/p>\n<p>We may accept an order to stop payment on any item from any one of you. You must make any stop-payment order in the manner required by law and we must receive it in time to give us a reasonable opportunity to act on it before our stop-payment cutoff time. Because stop-payment orders are handled by computers, to be effective, your stop-payment order must precisely identify the number, date, and amount of the item, and the payee. You may stop payment on any item drawn on your account whether you sign the item or not. Generally, if your stop-payment order is given to us in writing it is effective for six months. Your order will lapse after that time if you do not renew the order in writing before the end of the six-month period.<\/p>\n<p>If the original stop-payment order was oral your stop-payment order will lapse after 14 calendar days if you do not confirm your order in writing within that time period. We are not obligated to notify you when a stop-payment order expires.<\/p>\n<p>If you stop payment on an item and we incur any damages or expenses because of the stop payment, you agree to indemnify us for those damages or expenses, including attorneys' fees. You assign to us all rights against the payee or any other holder of the item. You agree to cooperate with us in any legal actions that we may take against such persons. You should be aware that anyone holding the item may be entitled to enforce payment against you despite the stop-payment order.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>TELEPHONE TRANSFERS -<\/strong> A telephone transfer of funds from this account to another account with us, if otherwise arranged for or permitted, may be made by the same persons and under the same conditions generally applicable to withdrawals made in writing. Limitations on the number of telephonic transfers from a savings account are described elsewhere.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION -<\/strong> We may change any term of this agreement. Rules governing changes in interest rates are provided separately in the Truth-in-Savings disclosure or in another document. For other changes, we will give you reasonable notice in writing or by any other method permitted by law. We may also close this account at any time upon reasonable notice to you and tender of the account balance personally or by mail. Items presented for payment after the account is closed may be dishonored. When you close your account, you are responsible for leaving enough money in the account to cover any outstanding items to be paid from the account. Reasonable notice depends on the circumstances, and in some cases such as when we cannot verify your identity or we suspect fraud, it might be reasonable for us to give you notice after the change or account closure becomes effective. For instance, if we suspect fraudulent activity with respect to your account, we might immediately freeze or close your account and then give you notice. If we have notified you of a change in any term of your account and you continue to have your account after the effective date of the change, you have agreed to the new term(s).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>STATEMENTS -<\/strong><br \/><strong>Your Duty to Report Unauthorized Signatures, Alterations and Forgeries -<\/strong> You must examine your statement of account with \"reasonable promptness.\" If you discover (or reasonably should have discovered) any unauthorized signatures or alterations, you must promptly notify us of the relevant facts. As between you and us, if you fail to do either of these duties, you will have to either share the loss with us, or bear the loss entirely yourself (depending on whether we used ordinary care and, if not, whether we substantially contributed to the loss). The loss could be not only with respect to items on the statement but other items with unauthorized signatures or alterations by the same wrongdoer.<\/p>\n<p>You agree that the time you have to examine your statement and report to us will depend on the circumstances, but will not, in any circumstance, exceed a total of 30 days from when the statement is first sent or made available to you.<\/p>\n<p>You further agree that if you fail to report any unauthorized signatures, alterations, or forgeries in your account within 60 days of when we first send or make the statement available, you cannot assert a claim against us on any items in that statement, and as between you and us the loss will be entirely yours. This 60-day limitation is without regard to whether we used ordinary care. The limitation in this paragraph is in addition to that contained in the first paragraph of this section.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your Duty to Report Other Errors or Problems - <\/strong>In addition to your duty to review your statements for unauthorized signatures, alterations and forgeries, you agree to examine your statement with reasonable promptness for any other error or problem - such as an encoding error or an unexpected deposit amount. Also, if you receive or we make available either your items or images of your items, you must examine them for any unauthorized or missing endorsements or any other problems. You agree that the time you have to examine your statement and items and report to us will depend on the circumstances. However, this time period shall not exceed 60 days. Failure to examine your statement and items and report any errors to us within 60 days of when we first send or make the statement available precludes you from asserting a claim against us for any errors on items identified in that statement and as between you and us the loss will be entirely yours.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Errors Relating to Electronic Fund Transfers or Substitute Check -<\/strong> For information on errors relating to electronic fund transfers (e.g., on-line, mobile, debit card or ATM transactions) refer to your Electronic Fund Transfers disclosure and the sections on consumer liability and error resolution. For information on errors relating to a substitute check you received, refer to your disclosure entitled Substitute Checks and Your Rights.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Duty to Notify if Statement Not Received - <\/strong>You agree to immediately notify us if you do not receive your statement by the date you normally expect to receive it. Not receiving your statement in a timely manner is a sign that there may be an issue with your account, such as possible fraud or identity theft.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>ACCOUNT TRANSFER -<\/strong> This account may not be transferred or assigned without our prior written consent.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DIRECT DEPOSITS -<\/strong> If we are required for any reason to reimburse the federal government for all or any portion of a benefit payment that was directly deposited into your account, you authorize us to deduct the amount of our liability to the federal government from the account or from any other account you have with us, without prior notice and at any time, except as prohibited by law. We may also use any other legal remedy to recover the amount of our liability.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>TEMPORARY ACCOUNT AGREEMENT -<\/strong> If the account documentation indicates that this is a temporary account agreement, each person who signs to open the account or has authority to make withdrawals (except as indicated to the contrary) may transact business on this account. However, we may at some time in the future restrict or prohibit further use of this account if you fail to comply with the requirements we have imposed within a reasonable time.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SETOFF - <\/strong>We may (without prior notice and when permitted by law) set off the funds in this account against any due and payable debt any of you owe us now or in the future If this account is owned by one or more of you as individuals, we may set off any funds in the account against a due and payable debt a partnership owes us now or in the future, to the extent of your liability as a partner for the partnership debt. If your debt arises from a promissory note, then the amount of the due and payable debt will be the full amount we have demanded, as entitled under the terms of the note, and this amount may include any portion of the balance for which we have properly accelerated the due date.<\/p>\n<p>This right of setoff does not apply to this account if prohibited by law. For example, the right of setoff does not apply to this account if: (a) it is an Individual Retirement Account or similar tax-deferred account, or (b) the debt is created by a consumer credit transaction under a credit card plan (but this does not affect our rights under any consensual security interest), or (c) the debtor's right of withdrawal only arises in a representative capacity. We will not be liable for the dishonor of any check when the dishonor occurs because we set off a debt against this account. You agree to hold us harmless from any claim arising as a result of our exercise of our right of setoff.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>AUTHORIZED SIGNER -<\/strong> A single individual is the owner. The authorized signer is merely designated to conduct transactions on the owner's behalf. The owner does not give up any rights to act on the account, and the authorized signer may not in any manner affect the rights of the owner or beneficiaries, if any, other than by withdrawing funds from the account. The owner is responsible for any transactions of the authorized signer. We undertake no obligation to monitor transactions to determine that they are on the owner's behalf.<\/p>\n<p>The owner may terminate the authorization at any time, and the authorization is automatically terminated by the death of the owner. However, we may continue to honor the transactions of the authorized signer until: (a) we have received written notice or have actual knowledge of the termination of authority, and (b) we have a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice or knowledge. We may refuse to accept the designation of an authorized signer.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>RESTRICTIVE LEGENDS OR ENDORSEMENTS - <\/strong>The automated processing of the large volume of checks we receive prevents us from inspecting or looking for restrictive legends, restrictive endorsements or other special instructions on every check. For this reason, we are not required to honor any restrictive legend or endorsement or other special instruction placed on checks you write unless we have agreed in writing to the restriction or instruction. Unless we have agreed in writing, we are not responsible for any losses, claims, damages, or expenses that result from your placement of these restrictions or instructions on your checks. Examples of restrictive legends placed on checks are \"must be presented within 90 days\" or \"not valid for more than $1,000.00.\" The payee's signature accompanied by the words \"for deposit only\" is an example of a restrictive endorsement.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>FACSIMILE SIGNATURES -<\/strong> Unless you make advance arrangements with us, we have no obligation to honor facsimile signatures on your checks or other orders. If we do agree to honor items containing facsimile signatures, you authorize us, at any time, to charge you for all checks, drafts, or other orders, for the payment of money, that are drawn on us. You give us this authority regardless of by whom or by what means the facsimile signature(s) may have been affixed so long as they resemble the facsimile signature specimen filed with us, and contain the required number of signatures for this purpose. You must notify us at once if you suspect that your facsimile signature is being or has been misused.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CHECK PROCESSING - <\/strong>We process items mechanically by relying solely on the information encoded in magnetic ink along the bottom of the items. This means that we do not individually examine all of your items to determine if the item is properly completed, signed and endorsed or to determine if it contains any information other than what is encoded in magnetic ink. You agree that we have exercised ordinary care if our automated processing is consistent with general banking practice, even though we do not inspect each item. Because we do not inspect each item, if you write a check to multiple payees, we can properly pay the check regardless of the number of endorsements unless you notify us in writing that the check requires multiple endorsements. We must receive the notice in time for us to have a reasonable opportunity to act on it, and you must tell us the precise date of the check, amount, check number and payee. We are not responsible for any unauthorized signature or alteration that would not be identified by a reasonable inspection of the item. Using an automated process helps us keep costs down for you and all account holders.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>CHECK CASHING -<\/strong> We may charge a fee for anyone that does not have an account with us who is cashing a check, draft or other instrument written on your account. We may also require reasonable identification to cash such a check, draft or other instrument. We can decide what identification is reasonable under the circumstances and such identification may be documentary or physical and may include collecting a thumbprint or fingerprint.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>TRUNCATION, SUBSTITUTE CHECKS, AND OTHER CHECK IMAGES - <\/strong>If you truncate an original check and create a substitute check, or other paper or electronic image of the original check, you warrant that no one will be asked to make payment on the original check, a substitute check or any other electronic or paper image, if the payment obligation relating to the original check has already been paid. You also warrant that any substitute check you create conforms to the legal requirements and generally accepted specifications for substitute checks. You agree to retain the original check in conformance with our internal policy for retaining original checks. You agree to indemnify us for any loss we may incur as a result of any truncated check transaction you initiate. We can refuse to accept substitute checks that have not previously been warranted by a bank or other financial institution in conformance with the Check 21 Act. Unless specifically stated in a separate agreement between you and us, we do not have to accept any other electronic or paper image of an original check.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>REMOTELY CREATED CHECKS - <\/strong>Like any standard check or draft, a remotely created check (sometimes called a telecheck, preauthorized draft or demand draft) is a check or draft that can be used to withdraw money from an account. Unlike a typical check or draft, however, a remotely created check is not issued by the paying bank and does not contain the signature of the account owner (or a signature purported to be the signature of the account owner). In place of a signature, the check usually has a statement that the owner authorized the check or has the owner's name typed or printed on the signature line.<\/p>\n<p>You warrant and agree to the following for every remotely created check we receive from you for deposit or collection: (1) you have received express and verifiable authorization to create the check in the amount and to the payee that appears on the check; (2) you will maintain proof of the authorization for at least 2 years from the date of the authorization, and supply us the proof if we ask; and (3) if a check is returned you owe us the amount of the check, regardless of when the check is returned. We may take funds from your account to pay the amount you owe us, and if there are insufficient funds in your account, you still owe us the remaining balance.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>UNLAWFUL INTERNET GAMBLING NOTICE -<\/strong> Restricted transactions as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation GG are prohibited from being processed through this account or relationship. Restricted transactions generally include, but are not limited to, those in which credit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with the participation by others in unlawful Internet gambling.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>ACH AND WIRE TRANSFERS -<\/strong> This agreement is subject to Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code - Fund Transfers as adopted in the state in which you have your account with us. If you originate a fund transfer and you identify by name and number a beneficiary financial institution, an intermediary financial institution or a beneficiary, we and every receiving or beneficiary financial institution may rely on the identifying number to make payment. We may rely on the number even if it identifies a financial institution, person or account other than the one named. You agree to be bound by automated clearing house association rules. These rules provide, among other things, that payments made to you, or originated by you, are provisional until final settlement is made through a Federal Reserve Bank or payment is otherwise made as provided in Article 4A-403(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code. If we do not receive such payment, we are entitled to a refund from you in the amount credited to your account and the party originating such payment will not be considered to have paid the amount so credited. Credit entries may be made by ACH. If we receive a payment order to credit an account you have with us by wire or ACH, we are not required to give you any notice of the payment order or credit.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>","interactive":true,"renderVarHtml":false},"component":"FormHtmlViewer","inspector":[{"type":"FormTextArea","field":"content","config":{"rows":5,"label":"Content","value":null,"helper":"The HTML text to display"}},{"type":"FormCheckbox","field":"renderVarHtml","config":{"label":"Render HTML from a Variable","value":null,"helper":null}},{"type":"FormInput","field":"conditionalHide","config":{"label":"Visibility Rule","helper":"This control is hidden until this expression is true"}},{"type":"FormInput","field":"customFormatter","config":{"label":"Custom Format String","helper":"Use the Mask Pattern format <br> Date ##\/##\/#### <br> SSN ###-##-#### <br> Phone (###) ###-####","validation":null}},{"type":"FormInput","field":"customCssSelector","config":{"label":"CSS Selector Name","helper":"Use this in your custom css rules","validation":"regex: [-?[_a-zA-Z]+[_-a-zA-Z0-9]*]"}},{"type":"FormInput","field":"ariaLabel","config":{"label":"Aria Label","helper":"Attribute designed to help assistive technology (e.g. screen readers) attach a label"}},{"type":"FormInput","field":"tabindex","config":{"label":"Tab Order","helper":"Order in which a user will move focus from one control to another by pressing the Tab key","validation":"regex: [0-9]*"}}],"editor-control":"FormHtmlEditor","editor-component":"FormHtmlEditor"}]}],"computed":[],"custom_css":null,"created_at":"2022-08-30T19:41:37+00:00","updated_at":"2022-08-30T19:42:13+00:00","status":"ACTIVE","key":null,"watchers":[],"categories":[{"id":1,"name":"Uncategorized","status":"ACTIVE","is_system":0,"created_at":"2022-04-26T18:01:14+00:00","updated_at":"2022-04-26T18:01:14+00:00","pivot":{"assignable_id":453,"category_id":1,"category_type":"ProcessMaker\\Models\\ScreenCategory"}}]}],"screen_categories":[],"scripts":[]}
